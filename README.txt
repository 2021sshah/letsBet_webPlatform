Summary:
Our platform provides a place where users can place bets peer-to-peer without being exploited by casinos and corporations. The product allows users to freely create their own betting lines, with dynamic crowd sourced odds. This gives incentive to skilled bettors to use our platform. The house can’t always win if there isn’t a house. Additionally, the platform acts as a social media platform where users can engage in and discuss betting with friends. Unlike being a bookie or a casino, it is mathematically impossible to lose money running this model as the users bet against each other while we simply charge processing fees.
